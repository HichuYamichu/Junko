# Junko

#### ~~shameless rip off but it's pretty cool~~

## What is this?

Junko is ~~barely~~ Touhou themed discord bot with very little actual functionality. Main purpose of this repo is to try out and play around with some cool stuff. As of now this project includes the Discord.js/Akairo bot, Nuxt.js dashboard, GraphQl api and Grafana metrics dashboard powered by Prometheus and Loki.

## Get your own

go to env directory, rename all .env.example files to .env and fill them with apropriate data

```bash
# with docker:
docker-compose up

# without docker:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
# you need build tools for sure also Go modules can come in handy
```
